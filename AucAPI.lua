	Auctioneer Addon for World of Warcraft(tm).
	Version: 3.9.0.1000 (Kangaroo)
	Revision: $Id: AucAPI.lua 972 2006-08-22 19:05:01Z mentalpower $

	Auctioneer data access and management.
	Functions central to setting/getting any data from Auctioneer.

	Note to authors of any addons wanting to utilize Auctioneer data:
	If you do not see the function you want here, please ask for it to be added.
	This is the only place that we guarantee the function prototypes will not change.
	If you use any of the internal functions, one day your addon will stop working :)
